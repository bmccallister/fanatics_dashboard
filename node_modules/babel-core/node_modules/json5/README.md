# JSON5 – Modern JSON

JSON is an excellent data format, but we think it can be better.

**JSON5 is a proposed extension to JSON** that aims to make it easier for
*humans to write and maintain* by hand. It does this by adding some minimal
syntax features directly from ECMAScript 5.

JSON5 remains a **strict subset of JavaScript**, adds **no new data types**,
and **works with all existing JSON content**.

JSON5 is *not* an official successor to JSON, and JSON5 content may *not*
work with existing JSON parsers. For this reason, JSON5 files use a new .json5
extension. *(TODO: new MIME type needed too.)*

The code here is a **reference JavaScript implementation** for both Node.js
and all browsers. It's based directly off of Douglas Crockford's own [JSON
implementation][json_parse.js], and it's both robust and secure.


## Why

JSON isn't the friendliest to *write*. Keys need to be quoted, objects and
arrays can't have trailing commas, and comments aren't allowed — even though
none of these are the case with regular JavaScript today.

That was fine when JSON's goal was to be a great data format, but JSON's usage
has expanded beyond *machines*. JSON is now used for writing [configs][ex1],
[manifests][ex2], even [tests][ex3] — all by *humans*.

[ex2]: http://npmjs.org/doc/json.html
[ex3]: http://code.google.com/p/fuzztester/wiki/JSONFileFormat

There are other formats that are human-friendlier, like YAML, but changing
from JSON to a completely different format is undesirable in many cases.
JSON5’s aim is to remain close to JSON and JavaScript.


## Features

The following is the exact list of additions to JSON's syntax introduced by
JSON5. **All of these are optional**, and **all of these come from ES5**.

### Objects

- Object keys can be unquoted if they're valid [identifiers][mdn_variables].
  Yes, even reserved keywords (like `default`) are valid unquoted keys in ES5
  [[§11.1.5](http://es5.github.com/#x11.1.5), [§7.6](http://es5.github.com/#x7.6)].

  *(TODO: Unicode characters and escape sequences aren’t yet supported in this
  implementation.)*

- Objects can have trailing commas.

[mdn_variables]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Core_Language_Features#Variables

### Arrays

- Arrays can have trailing commas.

### Strings

- Strings can be single-quoted.

- Strings can be split across multiple lines; just prefix each newline with a
  backslash. [ES5 [§7.8.4](http://es5.github.com/#x7.8.4)]

### Numbers

- Numbers can be hexadecimal (base 16). (But note that neither signed
  hexadecimals nor hexadecimal floats are allowed by ES5.)

- Numbers can begin or end with a (leading or trailing) decimal point.

- Numbers can include `Infinity` and `-Infinity`.

- Numbers can begin with an explicit plus sign.

### Comments

- Both inline (single-line) and block (multi-line) comments are allowed.


## Example

The following is a contrived example, but it illustrates most of the features:

```js
{
    foo: 'bar',
    while: true,

    this: 'is a \
multi-line string',

    // this is an inline comment
    here: 'is another', // inline comment

    /* this is a block comment
       that continues on another line */

    hex: 0xDEADbeef,
    half: .5,
    delta: +10,
    to: Infinity,   // and beyond!

    finally: 'a trailing comma',
    oh: [
        "we shouldn't forget",
        'arrays can have',
        'trailing commas too',
    ],
}
```
