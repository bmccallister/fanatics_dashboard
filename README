Fanatics - Project: TABLEAU
---------------------------------------------------------

    Project Descriptions:
        This project exists to allow for the creation of componentized graphical representations of health status of individual components such as TCS, the OMS, etc.
    
    Technology:
        This project utilizes NodeJS version 4.0 as well as React for the front end, with RabbitMQ as the message queue and CouchBase as the NoSQL database system.
    
    This project is made up of the following components:
        Frontend - This is the react (ES6) front end that displays the system agnostic components and updates their status via remote API calls at a set interval
        
        Server - This is the http server that is responsible for the passthrough webhosting on port 8888 as well as the the API server at endpoint /api which allows 
            for data requests against the couchbase database.  Additionally the server project contains the ./data/createData subproject which will create and 
            commission your couchbase documents
        
        Rabbit - This is a simple project which allows for messages sent through rabbit to propogate to the server and drive changes all the way to the front end
    
        Couchbase - This is the NoSQL Database which we'll be housing our data in.  Please follow these steps to commission your system
            1. Install couchbase (...)
            2. Remove any/all sample buckets
            3. Verify that you have at least 512M of space for your cluster by Clicking "Settings" from the couchbase administrative portal, and adjusting "Data RAM Quota" under "Custer Ram Quota" and ensure its at least 512M
            4. Create your new data buckets
                a) Click "Data Buckets"
                b) Click "Create New Data Bucket"
                c) Enter "tableau_components" for the Bucket name
                d) Ensure "Per Node Ram Quota" is 256M
                e) Under "Replicas" - de-select "Enable"
                f) Click "Create" at the bottom of the page
                g) Repeat steps b-f for "tableau_data"
            5. Create your primary indexes (Note, the api WILL NOT WORK without primary indexes)
                a) In Windows, go to http://localhost:8091/ui/index.html#/query/workbench
                b) enter:
                    CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `tableau_components` USING GSI;
                c) click "Execute"
                d) Repeat the process for "tableau_data"
            6. Your couchbase system is commissioned!

    Getting Started
    
    Frontend:
        Installing:
            cd /PROJECT/frontend
            npm i    
            
        Starting:
            Option 1: ( To start the server in a separate terminal)
                cd /PROJECT/frontend
                webpack --progress --colors --watch" 
        
            Option 2: (To use npm and run both the api and the front end watcher in the same terminal)
                cd /PROJECT/
                npm run serve
                
    Rabbit: (Assumes rabbitMQ is already installed on the local machine!)
        Installing:
            cd /PROJECT/rabbit
            npm i
        
        Starting:
            cd /PROJECT/rabbit
            node recieve.js
    
        Testing: (With recieve running)
            cd /PROJECT/rabbit
            Mac/*Nix
                node send.js -- '{"id": "tcs_load1","payload": {"averageResponse": "5"}}'
            Windows
                node send.js -- "{""id"": ""tcs_load1"",""payload"": {""averageResponse"": ""5""}}"
            
    Server:
        Configuration:
            The following FILE:
                /PROJECT/server/config.json
            Is where configuration data for the couchbase interface is stored.  Bucket data as well as the URI for the connectivity should be stored here.
            Out of the box, nothing should have to change, but this can be modified as needed.
        
        Installing:
            cd /PROJECT/server
            npm i
        
        Setting up: (Assumes couchbase is already installed!)
            cd /PROJECT/server/data
            node createData.js
                ( Output from this command should terminate with:
                    Process next returned remaining count:2
                    All components processed!
                    All rows created
                )
        
        Starting:
            cd /PROJECT/server
            (IN WINDOWS)
                npm start
            (IN A REAL OS)
                npm run fork // to start in background
                npm start // to run, synchronously in that terminal
                
        Testing:
            
            API:
                In a browser, go to 
                    http://YOURSERVER:8888/api/tableau_components/
                        This data should look like this:
                            [{"components":{"acceptPush":false,"apiInterval":1000,"description":"TCS Load Monitoring","interval":"1000","name":"tcs_load","thresholdFields":["averageResponse"],"values":[{"key":"load","name":"Load","threshold":[]},{"key":"averageResponse","name":"Response Time","threshold":["0","3","5","1000"]},{"key":"peakConcurrent","name":"Max Conc.","threshold":[]},{"key":"lastHour","name":"Hits (1 hr)","threshold":[]},{"key":"systemHealth","name":"System Health","threshold":["100%","90%","80%","0%"]}]}},{"components":{"acceptPush":false,"description":"TCS Order Monitoring","interval":"1000","module":"tcs_orders","name":"tcs_orders","thresholdFields":["abandonedOrders","conversionRate"],"values":[{"key":"orders","name":"Total Orders","threshold":[]},{"key":"fulfilledOrders","name":"Fulfilled Orders","threshold":["0","3","5"]},{"key":"abandonedOrders","name":"Abandoned Orders","threshold":[]},{"key":"stuckOrders","name":"Stuck Orders","threshold":["0%","5%","100%"]},{"key":"conversionRate","name":"Conversion Rate ","threshold":["10%","7%","3%","0%"]}]}}]
                            
                    http://104.236.217.180:8888/api/tableau_components/tcs_load
                        This data should look like this:
                            {"component":"tcs_load","id":"tcs_load1","load":"64","payload":{"averageResponse":"1","lastHour":"5000","load":"999","peakConcurrent":"50000","systemHealth":"99%"},"timestamp":"1470661893"}
                            
            Front End:
                http://104.236.217.180:8888/
                    This should display the front end dashboard.  Several items should be green under "TCS Load Monitoring", and several should be yellow, red and green under "TCS Orders"
            
            End to End:
                With the API and the Front End running, start the rabbit recieve process.
                With the browser open in one window, and a terminal open in the /PROJECT/rabbit folder, experiment with sending data packets to the rabbitMQ publisher
                    For example:
                        Mac/*NIX
                            node send.js -- '{"id": "tcs_load1","payload": {"averageResponse": "55"}}'
                        Windows
                            node send.js -- "{""id"": ""tcs_load1"",""payload"": {""averageResponse"": ""55""}}"
                        
                    With the above command, you should see the "Response Time" bauble turn red under TCS Load Monitoring, this indicates that the averageResponse time is outside of the tolerable threshold
                    as defined in the ComponentData sample we created.
                    
                    Similarly:
                        Mac/*Nix
                            node send.js -- '{"id": "tcs_load1","payload": {"averageResponse": "3"}}'
                        Windows
                            node send.js -- "{""id"": ""tcs_load1"",""payload"": {""averageResponse"": ""5""}}"
                            
                    Should change the bauble to yellow, as an average response time of 3 seconds is tolerable, but not great.


Troubleshooting:
    RabbitMQ on mac had some problems.      If you are unable to connect to rabbit with the receive.js in the rabbit project, determine if your guest user has been set up correctly.

    Run /RABBITINSTALL/sbin/rabbitmqctl list_users

    If no users have been created, then your installation did not create a user automatically.  This likely failed because it appears the erlang installation thats built into the "distributable" copy doesn't come with Crypto, thus the default guest/guest account is not created when the rabbitmqctl starts.

    This can be resolved by rolling back the default encryption method.

    Edit the /RABBITINSTALL/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config (Copy this file, if you still have rabbitmq.config.default)
    Locate the line {password_hashing_module, rabbit_password_hashing_sha512} (or whichever sha version is set) and change it to 
    {password_hashing_module, rabbit_password_hashing_md5}.
    If it is commented out with %%, uncomment this line.

    You will now need to create your user:
        ./rabbitmqctl add_user guest guest
    Give your user permissions to the '/' vhost
        ./rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / guest ".*" ".*" ".*"
